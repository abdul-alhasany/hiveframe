hiverframe is a mini PHP framework. It attempts to provide a simple, easy to use and OOP way to manage data flow and presentation between PHP and HTML. 

# Features
- Object oriented programming. Each "template" is represented through a PHP class.
- Small in size. Only one file of less than 500 lines to include in your project.

## Example

    --- index.php
    <?php
    require("hiverframe.php");
    class index extends hiveframe
    {
	    function view(){
	    
	    }
    }
